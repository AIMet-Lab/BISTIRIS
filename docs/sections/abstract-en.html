<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
BISTIRIS is an ontology developed to represent the rich diversity of traditional Sardinian costumes, capturing their physical and stylistic characteristics in a structured, machine-readable form. It enables domain experts to perform detailed, cross-referenced analyses based on elements often overlooked by other ontologies. The ontology supports cultural heritage documentation, research, and digital preservation, offering a semantically enriched model tailored to a uniquely local yet underrepresented tradition.</span>
