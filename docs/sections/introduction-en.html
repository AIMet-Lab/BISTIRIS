BISTIRIS is an ontology developed to formally describe the diversity of Sardinian traditional costumes, reflecting the unique cultural variations found across the island. Each costume differs in elements such as fabric, color, and decorative details, yet these features are often underrepresented in existing models.
BISTIRIS addresses this by offering a structured vocabulary that enables detailed annotation and comparison of costume elements. Designed for use by domain experts, the ontology supports documentation, research, and digital preservation efforts related to Sardinian cultural heritage.</span>
