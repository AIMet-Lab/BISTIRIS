BISTIRIS is an ontology designed to capture and represent the intricate variations of the Sardinian traditional costume —one of the most distinctive expressions of the island’s cultural identity. Sardinia, with its rich mosaic of local traditions, preserves a wide range of costumes that vary significantly across villages in terms of colors, materials, decorative elements, and symbolic meanings.
The ontology was developed to address the limitations of existing models, which often lack the granularity needed to describe the physical and stylistic features of traditional attire. One of the main goals of BIST`IRIS is to enable domain experts—such as anthropologists, ethnographers, and museum curators — to conduct cross-referenced searches and analyses based on detailed physical characteristics of costume elements.
By formalizing this knowledge through semantic technologies, BIST`IRIS not only supports advanced documentation and research, but also contributes to the digital preservation and accessibility of Sardinian cultural heritage. The ontology builds upon relevant standards while introducing new conceptualizations tailored to this unique and underrepresented domain.</span>
